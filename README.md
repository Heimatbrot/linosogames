# linosogames
This is just a fun project i did for a friendsgroup. This isn't clean code at all. It was created without much effort for clean structures.

## Demo
You can try the website live at: https://heimatbrot.github.io/linosogames

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository to your local machine:
Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/heimatbrot/linosogames.git
```
### Deployment
Just push it to your GitHub branch (in my example, the main branch is the websites branch). I Recommend doing a gh-pages branch and activate pages do deploy this one. As said before this isn't a clean project.
